## Hey üëã

I'm a product engineer and a writer.

I like to describe myself as a product engineer, as my aim isn't the tech but rather the outcome I'm producing.

I work across the entire stack: Frontend, Backend, Cloud, and Infrastructure as code, **but I specialize in Frontend (CSS, Accessibility, Performance, React and more).**

I'm an avid writer. I have both a [blog](https://tigerabrodi.blog/) and a [newsletter](https://www.saiyangrowthletter.com/). üòÅ

I'm also recognized as a [Hashnode Blogging Expert](https://tigerabrodi.blog/) with 100k+ blog reads.

If you're looking for my book on advanced JS, you can find it here: [Intermediate To Advanced JS](https://github.com/tigerabrodi/intermediate-to-advanced-js-book).

Libraries:

- [React Context Selector](https://github.com/tigerabrodi/react-context-selector) - A lightweight library for efficient React Context updates using selectors. (< 1kb gzipped)

Besides product stuff, I love to learn from first principles.

I do it either through writing or building things from scratch.

Some things I've built from scratch:

- [Zod from scratch](https://github.com/tigerabrodi/Zod-from-scratch)
- [Load balancer](https://github.com/tigerabrodi/load-balancer)
- [DNS Resolver](https://github.com/tigerabrodi/dns-resolver)
- [Rate Limiter](https://github.com/tigerabrodi/rate-limiter)
- [Load Tester](https://github.com/tigerabrodi/load-tester)

## Anime üôà

I love to watch anime.

My favorite one is Naruto. ü¶ä
