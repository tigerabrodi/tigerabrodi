## Hey 👋

I'm a product engineer and a writer.

I like to describe myself as a product engineer, as my aim isn't the tech but rather the outcome I'm producing.

I work across the entire stack: Frontend, Backend, Cloud, and Infrastructure as code, **but I specialize in Frontend (CSS, Accessibility, Performance, React and more).**

I'm an avid writer. I have both a [blog](https://tigerabrodi.blog/) and a [newsletter](https://www.saiyangrowthletter.com/). 😁

I'm also recognized as a [Hashnode Blogging Expert](https://tigerabrodi.blog/) with 100k+ blog reads.

If you're looking for my book on advanced JS, you can find it here: [Intermediate To Advanced JS](https://github.com/tigerabrodi/intermediate-to-advanced-js-book).

## Anime 🙈

I love to watch anime.

My favorite one is Naruto. 🦊
